## Introduction
In this program, I design a plugin that generates distortion.  The plugin can add distortion effects to the input sound and several other functions to adjust the pitch and increase it to the desired position, ultimately forming a new sound.  The basic functionality of this plugin is: <br/>
First and foremost, audio distortion is a versatile tool with a myriad of applications in audio design.  It can be seamlessly integrated into various music genres as a special effect, lending a unique texture to the composition.  
In sound design, it serves as a powerful medium for artistic expression, and in the realm of electronic music and synthesizers, it opens up a world of creative possibilities.  
This versatility underscores the indispensability of audio distortion in audio design. <br/>
Secondly, when audio plugins lack distortion effects, creating new audio plugins can help audio engineers better deal with various sound processing problems.  
When audio engineers use Reaper audio software to design, the audio editing software generally comes with many effects editing programs (to ensure simplicity and practicality).  
Therefore, audio designers must often import audio plugins from various external developers to complete necessary audio designs. 
Thus, the application of distortion effects software is essential. <br/>
